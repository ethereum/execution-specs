BAL Implementation Fixes Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tests for specific fixes made to the BAL implementation:
1. BAL tracker propagation to child messages
2. Simplified approach (no filtering of statically inferrable data)
3. Call and CREATE target tracking
4. Nonce tracking for all accounts
