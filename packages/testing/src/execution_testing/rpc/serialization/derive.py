"""
Enumerate JSON-RPC expectations from a filled blockchain fixture.

Nothing here is chosen by a test author. The calls are read off the chain
the test happened to produce: each block contributes a query by number and
by hash, and each transaction contributes a receipt lookup. The `rpc`
marker is only a switch — there is no parameter information for it to
carry.

That also bounds what this can cover. Enumeration answers "given this
chain, is the response correct"; it cannot answer "given a nonsensical
request, is the error correct", because no chain produces a nonsensical
request. Block tags, reversed ranges and missing entities belong in
hand-written tests instead.
