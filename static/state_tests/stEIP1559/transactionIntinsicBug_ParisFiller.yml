# geth was accepting this transaction as the total price was estimated to be 50M
# but it didn't account for value in the formula. therefor an invalid transaction passed through.
# because 50M is just the worst case scenario, the transaction passed with ~10M gas by current basefee and ~40M value transfer
# while at the same time not hitting out of balance, but technicaly invalid intrinsic gas as the worst case scenario would have been
# 50M + 40M value transfer (that would potentially hited out of balance in anouther block)
