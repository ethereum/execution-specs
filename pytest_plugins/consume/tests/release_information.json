It contains updates and fixes for the past genesis tests due to the addition of witness checks within the testing framework. These verify the correct behavoiur of the witness for specific test cases if defined.**\r\n\r\nA reasonable order of steps for client teams to start running tests can be found below, starting with the genesis tests from: `fixtures_verkle-genesis.tar.gz`\r\n- Run the EIP-6800 tests for a good first check, `fixtures/verkle/eip6800_genesis_verkle_tree/` within the extracted the fixture genesis tar.\r\n  - Followed by EIP-4762 tests: `fixtures/verkle/eip4762_verkle_gas_witness/`.\r\n  - And EIP-7709 tests: `fixtures/verkle/eip7709_blockhash_witness/`.\r\n- Run \"backfilled\" tests, all previous fork tests filled for Verkle, i.e all tests excluding`fixtures/verkle/*`.\r\n- (Optional) Run the `fixtures_verkle-conversion-stride-0.tar.gz` tests, as these contain basic pre-fork tests to make sure nothing is broken on the fork before Verkle.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* new(tests): eip-4762 *CALL with insufficient gas by @jsign in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/867\r\n* feat(verkle): add two-way exhaustive witness checks by @spencer-tb in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/879\r\n* eip4762: enable calls with insufficient gas tests again by @jsign in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/880\r\n* new(tests): eip-4762 contract creations with insufficient gas by @jsign in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/873\r\n* new(tests): eip-4762 EXTCODEHASH with insufficient gas by @jsign in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/874\r\n* new(tests): eip-4762 (EXT)CODECOPY with insufficient gas by @jsign in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/868\r\n* new(tests): eip-4762 SELFDESTRUCT with insufficient gas by @jsign in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/875\r\n* eip4762: SSTORE/SLOAD insufficient gas tests by @jsign in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/884\r\n* Filling fixes by @jsign in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/885\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/compare/verkle@v0.0.3...verkle@v0.0.4\r\n\r\n## 🐘 Verkle Genesis Test Fixtures\r\n\r\nContains verkle specific test vectors from https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/659 including all existing EEST test cases filled for a verkle configured fork.

Thus the MPT is not being converted to a VKT within these tests. The intention is to check that **only blocks after the transition** update the VKT, isolating VKT fork transition issues without touching MPT stride conversion logic.\r\n\r\nTest cases additionally include Shanghai genesis tests to assert that the fork before Verkle is not broken.\r\n\r\nPlease use `fixtures_verkle-conversion-stride-0.tar.gz`!\r\n\r\n### Generating Conversion Fixtures\r\n\r\nUsing the geth evm binary from this [commit](https://github.com/gballet/go-ethereum/commit/a00d50aa1590d7bed660723e2aa2fc7e58d64559), fill with the following command:\r\n```\r\nfill --from Shanghai --until EIP6800Transition --evm-bin=<path_to_geth_evm> -n auto -m blockchain_test\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "⚠️ **Note these tests are up to date with the latest devnet-7 spec!**\r\n\r\n**This release is filled with a specific geth branch [`gballet/jsign-witness-fix`](https://github.com/gballet/go-ethereum/pull/495) aligned with devnet-7. It contains updates and fixes for the past genesis tests due to the addition of witness checks within the testing framework. These verify the correct behavoiur of the witness for specific test cases if defined.**\r\n\r\nA reasonable order of steps for client teams to start running tests can be found below, starting with the genesis tests from: `fixtures_verkle-genesis.tar.gz`\r\n- Run the EIP-6800 tests for a good first check, `fixtures/verkle/eip6800_genesis_verkle_tree/` within the extracted the fixture genesis tar.\r\n  - Followed by EIP-4762 tests: `fixtures/verkle/eip4762_verkle_gas_witness/`.\r\n  - And EIP-7709 tests: `fixtures/verkle/eip7709_blockhash_witness/`.\r\n- Run \"backfilled\" tests, all previous fork tests filled for Verkle, i.e all tests excluding`fixtures/verkle/*`.\r\n- (Optional) Run the `fixtures_verkle-conversion-stride-0.tar.gz` tests, as these contain basic pre-fork tests to make sure nothing is broken on the fork before Verkle.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/compare/verkle@v0.0.3...verkle@v0.0.4\r\n\r\n## 🐘 Verkle Genesis Test Fixtures\r\n\r\nContains verkle specific test vectors from https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/659 including all existing EEST test cases filled for a verkle configured fork. Note these tests assume the MPT to VKT conversion has completed where we start at the Verkle fork.\r\n\r\nPlease use `fixtures_verkle-genesis.tar.gz`!\r\n\r\n### Generating Genesis Fixtures\r\n\r\nUsing the geth evm binary from this [commit](https://github.com/gballet/go-ethereum/commit/a00d50aa1590d7bed660723e2aa2fc7e58d64559), fill with the following command:\r\n```\r\nfill --fork Verkle --evm-bin=<path_to_geth_evm> -n auto -m blockchain_test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔁 Verkle Conversion Test Fixtures - 0 Stride\r\n\r\nThese aim to verify a basic fork transition from Shanghai to Verkle. 0 stride denotes that the initial MPT remains frozen. Thus the MPT is not being converted to a VKT within these tests. The intention is to check that **only blocks after the transition** update the VKT, isolating VKT fork transition issues without touching MPT stride conversion logic.\r\n\r\nTest cases additionally include Shanghai genesis tests to assert that the fork before Verkle is not broken.\r\n\r\nPlease use `fixtures_verkle-conversion-stride-0.tar.gz`!\r\n\r\n### Generating Conversion Fixtures\r\n\r\nUsing the geth evm binary from this [commit](https://github.com/gballet/go-ethereum/commit/a00d50aa1590d7bed660723e2aa2fc7e58d64559), fill with the following command:\r\n```\r\nfill --from Shanghai --until EIP6800Transition --evm-bin=<path_to_geth_evm> -n auto -m blockchain_test\r\n```\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "⚠️ **Note these tests are up to date with the latest devnet-7 spec!**\r\n\r\n**This release is equivalent to [verkle@v0.0.2](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/verkle%40v0.0.2) but filled with the latest geth [`gballet/kaustinen-with-shapella`](https://github.com/gballet/go-ethereum/tree/kaustinen-with-shapella) branch aligned with devnet-7.**\r\n\r\nFrom the [VIC no 23 testing slides](https://hackmd.io/@jsign/verkle-testing#/4), a reasonable order of steps for client teams to start running tests can be found below, starting with the genesis tests from: `fixtures_verkle-genesis.tar.gz`\r\n- Run EIP-6800 tests (~23) for a good first check, `fixtures/verkle/eip6800_genesis_verkle_tree/` within the extracted the fixture genesis tar.\r\n- Run \"backfilled\" tests (~300), all tests excluding`fixtures/verkle/*`.\r\n- Wait for the next release to run additional tests after framework witness assertions verify the remaining test cases.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/compare/verkle@v0.0.2...verkle@v0.0.3\r\n\r\n## 🌪️ Fixture Format Changes\r\n\r\nAll fixtures now contain a block witness although currently without the parent state root.\r\n```python\r\nclass Witness(CamelModel):\r\n    state_diff: StateDiff\r\n    verkle_proof: VerkleProof\r\n```\r\nClient test consumers can now utilize this to compare there computed block witness against the witness contained within the fixtures (computed from geth's t8n).\r\n\r\nFor more information on our witness definition please adhere to [`src/ethereum_test_types/verkle/types.py`](https://github.com/jsign/execution-spec-tests/blob/jsign-verkle-rebased-mainnet/src/ethereum_test_types/verkle/types.py).\r\n\r\nAdditionally the post state is removed. Future fixture releases will contain the post state as a VKT.\r\n\r\n## 🐘 Verkle Genesis Test Fixtures\r\n\r\nContains verkle specific test vectors from https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/659 including all existing EEST test cases filled for a verkle configured fork. Note these tests assume the MPT to VKT conversion has completed where we start at the Verkle fork.\r\n\r\nPlease use `fixtures_verkle-genesis.tar.gz`!\r\n\r\n### Generating Genesis Fixtures\r\n\r\nUsing the geth evm binary from this [commit](https://github.com/gballet/go-ethereum/commit/df132604b24104bcfcf838bf30495a279dd799f8), fill with the following command:\r\n```\r\nfill --fork Verkle --evm-bin=<path_to_geth_evm> -n auto -m blockchain_test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔁 Verkle Conversion Test Fixtures - 0 Stride\r\n\r\nContains an improvement to the initial set of transition [tests](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/eip6800%40v0.0.1).\r\n\r\nThese aim to verify a basic fork transition from Shanghai to Verkle. 0 stride denotes that the initial MPT remains frozen. Thus the MPT is not being converted to a VKT within these tests. The intention is to check that **only blocks after the transition** update the VKT, isolating VKT fork transition issues without touching MPT stride conversion logic.\r\n\r\nTest cases additionally include Shanghai genesis tests to assert that the fork before Verkle is not broken.\r\n\r\nThe next release will contain conversion tests with some stride enabled to dynamically validate the MPT conversion.\r\n\r\nPlease use `fixtures_verkle-conversion-stride-0.tar.gz`!\r\n\r\n### Generating Conversion Fixtures\r\n\r\nUsing the geth evm binary from this [commit](https://github.com/gballet/go-ethereum/commit/df132604b24104bcfcf838bf30495a279dd799f8), fill with the following command:\r\n```\r\nfill --from Shanghai --until EIP6800Transition --evm-bin=<path_to_geth_evm> -n auto -m blockchain_test\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "EEST's Petřín release adds many improvements and additions. Please read the breaking changes!\r\n\r\nA noteable key package `ethereum_test_tools` is now fragmented into several fine grained packages that are suitable for use within other Python based repositories.\r\n\r\nThe consume simulator pytest plugin now contains 4 fixture runners:\r\n- `consume direct`: provides a pytest wrapper to execute multiple fixtures against client evm `statetest/blocktest` runners.\r\n- `consume rlp`: using hive as a back-end, executes fixture block rlps against fully instantiated clients, verifying the last block hash is expected.\r\n- `consume engine`: with a hive back-end, sends `engine_newPayloadVX` calls against fully instantiated clients validating each call response.\r\n- `consume all`: provides a wrapper surrounding all commands to execute consume direct, rlp and engine at once for the specified fixtures.\r\n\r\nWith a refined consume suite, testers can now `fill` and `consume` the generated fixtures extremely quickly to validate both the generated fixture and client implementation. This removes the cumbersome requirement of updating hive when verifying new fixtures.\r\n\r\nTo align the [execution-apis](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/) engine specification with the `consume engine` plugin, the `blockchain_test_hive` fixture is renamed to `blockchain_test_engine` to align more with the sentiment of the spec. Similarly, the fixture format of the latter is changed to match the engine new payload `\"params\"` field defined in the spec.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 💥 Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- Cancun is now the latest deployed fork, and the development fork is now Prague ([#489](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/489)).\r\n- Stable fixtures artifact `fixtures.tar.gz` has been renamed to `fixtures_stable.tar.gz` ([#573](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/573))\r\n- The \"Blockchain Test Hive\" fixture format has been renamed to \"Blockchain Test Engine\" and updated to more closely resemble the `engine_newPayload` format in the `execution-apis` specification (https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/prague.md#request) and now contains a single `\"params\"` field instead of multiple fields for each parameter ([#687](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/687)).\r\n- Output folder for fixtures has been renamed from \"blockchain_tests_hive\" to \"blockchain_tests_engine\" ([#687](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/687)).\r\n\r\n### 🧪 Test Cases\r\n\r\n- ✨ Add tests for eof container's section bytes position smart fuzzing ([#592](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/592)).\r\n- ✨ Add `test_create_selfdestruct_same_tx_increased_nonce` which tests self-destructing a contract with a nonce > 1 ([#478](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/478)).\r\n- ✨ Add `test_double_kill` and `test_recreate` which test resurrection of accounts killed with `SELFDESTRUCT` ([#488](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/488)).\r\n- ✨ Add eof example valid invalid tests from ori, fetch EOF Container implementation ([#535](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/535)).\r\n- ✨ Add tests for [EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537) ([#499](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/499)).\r\n- ✨ [EIP-663](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-663): Add `test_dupn.py` and `test_swapn.py` ([#502](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/502)).\r\n- ✨ Add tests for [EIP-6110: Supply validator deposits on chain](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6110) ([#530](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/530)).\r\n- ✨ Add tests for [EIP-7002: Execution layer triggerable withdrawals](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002) ([#530](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/530)).\r\n- ✨ Add tests for [EIP-7685: General purpose execution layer requests](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685) ([#530](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/530)).\r\n- ✨ Add tests for [EIP-2935: Serve historical block hashes from state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935) ([#564](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/564), [#585](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/585)).\r\n- ✨ Add tests for [EIP-4200: EOF -
