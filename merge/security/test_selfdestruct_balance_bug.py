bug: Tests the Consensus Flaw During Block Processing related to SELFDESTRUCT
    Tests the consensus-vulnerability reported in
    [go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-xw37-57qp-9mm4](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-xw37-57qp-9mm4).

To reproduce the issue with this test case:

1. Fill the test with the most recent geth evm version.
2. Run the fixture output within a vulnerable geth version: v1.9.20 > geth >=
    v1.9.4.

    """
    Test that the vulnerability is not present by checking the balance of the
    `0xaa` contract after executing specific transactions:

    1. Start with contract `0xaa` which has initial balance of 3 wei.
        `0xaa` contract code simply performs a self-destruct to itself.

    2. Send a transaction (tx 1) to invoke caller contract `0xcc` (which
        has a balance of 1 wei), which in turn invokes `0xaa` with a 1 wei call.

    3. Store the balance of `0xaa` after the first transaction
        is processed. `0xaa` self-destructed. Expected outcome: 0 wei.

    4. Send another transaction (tx 2) to call 0xaa with 5 wei.

    5. Store the balance of `0xaa` after the second transaction
        is processed. No self-destruct. Expected outcome: 5 wei.

    6. Verify that:
        - Call within tx 1 is successful, i.e `0xaa` self-destructed.
        - The balances of `0xaa` after each tx are correct.
        - During tx 2, code in `0xaa` does not execute,
            hence self-destruct mechanism does not trigger.
