# Adding a New Test

All test cases are located underneath the `tests` directory, which are then organized by fork. Each fork contains sub-directories containing test sub-categories.

```

Each category/sub-directory may have multiple Python test modules (`*.py`) which in turn may contain many test functions. The test functions themselves are always parametrized by fork (by the framework).

A new test can be added by either:

- Adding a new `test_` python function to an existing file in any of the existing category subdirectories within `tests`.
- Creating a new source file in an existing category, and populating it with the new test function(s).
- Creating an entirely new category by adding a subdirectory in `tests` with the appropriate source files and test functions.
