"""
A `Block` is a single link in the chain that is Ethereum. Each `Block` contains
a `Header` and zero or more transactions. Each `Header` contains associated
metadata like the block number, parent block hash, and how much gas was
consumed by its transactions.

Together, these blocks form a cryptographically secure journal recording the
history of all state transitions that have happened since the genesis of the
chain.
