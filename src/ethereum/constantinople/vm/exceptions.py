Exceptions which cause the EVM to halt exceptionally.
"""

from ethereum.exceptions import EthereumException


class ExceptionalHalt(EthereumException):
    """
    Indicates that the EVM has experienced an exceptional halt. This causes
    execution to immediately end with all gas being consumed.
    """


class Revert(EthereumException):
    """
    Raised by the `REVERT` opcode.

    Unlike other EVM exceptions this does not result in the consumption of all
    gas.

    """
    Occurs when a pop is executed on an empty stack.
    """

class StackOverflowError(ExceptionalHalt):
    """
    Occurs when a push is executed on a stack at max capacity.

class OutOfGasError(ExceptionalHalt):
    """
    Occurs when an operation costs more than the amount of gas left in the
    frame.

    Raised when an invalid opcode is encountered.

    Occurs when the destination of a jump operation doesn't meet any of the
    following criteria:

      * The jump destination is less than the length of the code.
      * The jump destination should have the `JUMPDEST` opcode (0x5B).

        `PUSH-N` opcodes.

    Raised when an attempt was made to read data beyond the
