### Introduction

Seeing as internet connections have been vastly expanding across the
world, spreading information has become as cheap as ever. Bitcoin, for
example, has demonstrated the possibility of creating a decentralized,
trade system that is accessible around the world. Namecoin is another
system that built off of Bitcoin's currency structure to create other
simple technological applications.

Ethereum's goal is to create a cryptographically secure system in which
any and all types of transaction-based concepts can be built. It provides
an exceptionally accessible and decentralized system to build software
and execute transactions.

This package contains a reference implementation, written as simply as
possible, to aid in defining the behavior of Ethereum clients.
